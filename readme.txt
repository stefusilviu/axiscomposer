AxisComposer is a powerful, extendable page builder plugin that helps you compose anything. Beautifully.

== Description ==

Take full control over your WordPress website, build any page layout you can imagine smartly with the help of drag and drop interface. Delivering enterprise-level quality and features, backed by a name you can trust. Say "hello" to the AxisComposer plugin.

AxisComposer is built by the experienced folk at AxisThemes who also offer premium [WordPress themes](http://axisthemes.com/product-category/themes/ "WordPress themes from AxisThemes") and [AxisComposer extensions](http://axisthemes.com/product-category/axiscomposer-extensions/ "AxisComposer extensions from AxisThemes") to further enhance your WordPress website.

= Strength & flexibility =
AxisComposer is built using WordPress best practises both on the front and the back end. This results in an efficient, robust and intuitive plugin.

Translators can contribute new languages to AxisComposer through [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/axiscomposer/).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of AxisComposer, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “AxisComposer” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our page builder plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our page builder plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

= Dummy data =

AxisComposer comes with some dummy data you can use to see how page layouts look; either import dummy_data.xml via the [WordPress importer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-importer/).
